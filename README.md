# Docker & Digital Ocean Experiments
Playing with CodeAnywhere, DigitalOcean, and Docker in tandem. Pushing to this repo over SSH from my container at the SF data center.

## Mission Log: Day 1
First day using nginx and managed to not only SSH into my first Digital Ocean Droplet, but set up the SSL certs on auto-renew via Let's Encrypt.
Not too bad, if I do say so myself... very happy. :)
